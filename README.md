# Sickness

Tracking issues and data to figure out why I'm sick, using [this Kanban board](https://github.com/waldoj/sickness/projects/1). *Update:* Thanks to this process, and the contributions of dozens of people here and on Twitter, I'm cured. The problem turned out to be [chronic sleep insufficiency](https://github.com/waldoj/sickness/issues/31).

## History

In the last week of August 2017, I developed the symptoms of a cold. It remained low level until September 4 2017, when I felt sick enough to take the day off of work. I never got better. After a month I figured I'd developed seasonal allergies (something I've never had before), but the symptoms were not alleviated by either taking over-the-counter allergy medications or by a week-long trip to India in October. In early November I finally went to my physician, who prescribed allergy medication. That began months of medical appointments to try to identify the source of the problem.

## Symptoms

* headache, often
* fatigue
* often sleepy
* often have a runny nose or stuffy nose
* foggy-headed
* thinking is much less nimble
* physical labor in hot weather is _draining_
* easily made lightheaded by e.g. bending over
